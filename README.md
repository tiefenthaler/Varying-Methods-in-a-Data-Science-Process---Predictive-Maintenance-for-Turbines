# Varying-Methods-in-a-Data-Science-Process---Predictive-Maintenance-for-Turbines
Demonstration of varying methods for the data science project: 'Predictive Maintenance for Turbines'. Even though the methods used in this project follow the act of a use case and are therefore sequential, they are a selection only and this is not meant to be a full stack project.
